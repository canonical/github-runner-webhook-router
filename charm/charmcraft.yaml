description: |
    The github-runner-webhook-router is a simple Flask application that listens for incoming webhooks
    from GitHub and places a translation of those in a message queue for a runner to pick up and process.
    It is intended to be used together with the Github Runner operator in reactive mode.

         description: |
            YAML configuration of the assignment of labels to flavours to which the job is to be routed.
            The format is comprised of a list of flavors with respective labels:
            - flavour1: [label1, label2]
            - flavour2: [label1, label3]
            If a job matches multiple flavours, the first flavour matching defined in this configuration will be used.
            If only the github provided default labels (self-hosted, linux) are used, the first flavour in the list will be used.
            Note that labels are treated case-insensitive. You should also not use the char # due to technical limitations.
